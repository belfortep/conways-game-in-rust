# conways-game-in-rust
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life with Rust and Web Assembly

To run with some selected points from a file, just do ´make run FILE=file_name´, if you don't provide any file, it will use the ´points.txt´ file as an example
Or you can type ´cargo run 0,0:1,0:....´ to pass the points yourself
